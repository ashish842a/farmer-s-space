                <h1>General Problems faced by Farmers: </h1>
                <h4>1. Low crop prices and inadequate remuneration for their produce: </h4>
                <p>Farmers often receive low prices for their crops due to the absence of a regulated market and the
                    lack of bargaining power.</p>

                <h4>2. Lack of access to credit and financial resources: </h4>
                <p> Many farmers struggle to obtain adequate financing to invest in their farms, leading to low
                    productivity and increased debt.</p>

                <h4>3. Water scarcity and unreliable irrigation systems:</h4>
                <p> Many farmers are dependent on monsoon rains for agriculture, and face challenges in accessing
                    sufficient water for irrigation during dry seasons.</p>

                <h4>4. Pests and disease outbreaks:</h4>
                <p> Farmers often face crop losses due to the spread of pests and diseases, which can be devastating to
                    their livelihoods.</p>

                <h4>5. Soil degradation and declining soil fertility: </h4>
                <p> Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can lead to soil degradation and declining soil
                    fertility, affecting crop yields and farmers' income.</p>

                <h4>6. Lack of storage and transportation facilities:</h4>
                <p> Farmers often face losses due to the absence of proper storage and transportation facilities,
                    leading to spoilage and wastage of their produce.</p>

                <h4>7. Dependence on intermediaries and middlemen: </h4>
                <p> Farmers often rely on intermediaries and middlemen to sell their produce, which can reduce their
                    bargaining power and income.</p>

                <h4>8. Lack of knowledge of government support and policies: </h4>
                <p>Farmers may face challenges in accessing government support and subsidies, and may feel that
                    government policies are not adequately addressing their concerns.</p>

                <h4>9. Natural disasters and climate change: </h4>
                <p>Farmers are vulnerable to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events,
                    which can lead to crop losses and financial losses.</p>

                <h4>10. Lack of access to technology and information:</h4>
                <p> Many farmers are not aware of new technologies and farming practices that can improve their
                    productivity and income.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="s-box">
                <h1>Solutions to the Problems:</h1>

                <h4>1. Grow different things:</h4>
                <p>Farmers can try growing different crops or livestock so they are not affected by changes in the
                    market.<br>For better yield and profitable results, farmers are advised to cultivate multiple crops,
                    including Apple, Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, Coconut, Ginger, Turmeric, and many others.</p>

                <h4>2. Adoption of technology:</h4>
                <p> Farmers can use technology such as precision agriculture, weather forecasting, and irrigation
                    systems to optimize their farming practices and improve crop yields.</p>

                <h4>3. Education and training: </h4>
                <p>Providing education and training to farmers can help them adopt new technologies and farming
                    practices, improve their management skills, and increase their incomes.<br>Many farmers are unaware
                    of crop rotation. Education is pretty much improved in urban areas, but the govt has overlooked the
                    need for the same in rural areas, particularly in the overall agriculture sector</p>

                <h4>4. Market access:</h4>
                <p>Farmers need access to markets where they can sell their products at fair prices. Governments and
                    private organizations can help by providing information on markets and facilitating connections
                    between farmers and buyers.</p>

                <h4>5. Financial support: </h4>
                <p>Farmers often need access to credit and other financial resources to purchase inputs, expand their
                    operations, and manage risks. Governments and financial institutions can provide loans and insurance
                    to help farmers overcome financial challenges.</p>

                <h4>6. Better Water Management</h4>
                <p>Water resources can be fully utilised through interstate coordination on water management; water can
                    easily be delivered to the areas where it is most required. Connecting the rivers and constructing
                    national waterways/channels will solve water supply problems and improve irrigation facility,
                    helping farmers in case monsoon fails.</p>

                <h4>7. Improving soil health:</h4>
                <p>Maintaining soil health through practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage can
                    improve crop yields and soil fertility.</p>

                <h4>8. Implementing integrated pest management:</h4>
                <p> Using a combination of natural and chemical pest control methods, as well as monitoring and early
                    detection, can reduce pest and disease damage to crops.</p>

                <h4>9. Proper storage and preservation: </h4>
                <p>Proper storage and preservation of crops can reduce waste and increase the shelf life of produce.</p>

                <h4>10. Marketing and financial planning:</h4>
                <p> Having a strong marketing strategy and sound financial planning can help farmers increase their
                    income and achieve long-term success.</p>
